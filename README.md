# Model Comparison and Evaluation

## Introduction
Get ready for an exciting face-off! We're comparing two big players in the world of digit guessing: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN). Let's see who wins !

## Model Overview
### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Our SVM model is armed with special tricks and scores an impressive 92.1% on the test. It's accurate and precise, just like a sharpshooter!

### Neural Network (NN)
The Neural Network is like a brain with many layers. It matches the SVM with around 92% accuracy, but it's smarter thanks to early stopping. No overthinking here!

## Evaluation Metrics
Both models are neck and neck with about 92% accuracy. They're consistent and reliable, just like your favorite team. Confusion matrices show where they shine and stumble.

## Visualizing Model Learning
But wait, there's more! Take a look at the final graph. It shows how the Neural Network learns over time. With each round of training, it gets smarter and more accurate. It's like watching a superhero train for the big battle!

## Conclusion
In the end, both SVM and NN are winners. They've mastered the art of guessing digits and proven themselves in the world of numbers. Here's to these digital heroes and their amazing skills!
