# MNIST Madness: SVM vs. NN Showdown!

## Let's Dive In
This wild ride is all about classifying those quirky handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. But hold on tight because we're taking two different routes: the classic Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the neural magic of a Neural Network (NN).

## The Dataset: A Glimpse Into Pixelated Chaos
Imagine a world of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten numbers (0 to 9). That's our playground!

## The SVM Story
Our SVM superhero swoops in with its RBF kernel, scoring a whopping 92.1% accuracy on the test set. Precision, recall, F1-score, and a whirlwind confusion matrix all point to one thing: solid performance.

## The Neural Network Saga
Enter the Neural Network, with layers stacked high. It dances its way to around 92% accuracy, armed with early stopping to keep the overfitting monsters at bay.

## Evaluation Extravaganza
Both contenders stand tall with similar accuracies, around 92%. Precision, recall, and F1-score? Consistently impressive across the board. And those confusion matrices? Oh, the tales they tell!

## The Grand Finale
It's a tie! SVM and NN both shine bright, proving their mettle in the chaotic world of handwritten digits. But hey, there's always room for a bit more magic with some fine-tuning. Cheers to the champions of digit classification!
